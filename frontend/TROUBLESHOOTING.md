# Troubleshooting Guide - AITRADERX Frontend

## Common React Errors and Solutions

### 1. "Too many re-renders" Error

**Cause**: React components causing infinite render loops, usually due to:
- Functions called during render without memoization
- State updates in render functions
- Unstable function references in useEffect dependencies

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Memoized render content with `useMemo`
- Wrapped callback functions with `useCallback`
- Optimized context providers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Moved function references outside render cycles

### 2. TradingView 403 Errors (content.js)

**Cause**: External browser extensions or third-party scripts trying to access TradingView APIs

**Solutions**:
- These errors are from browser extensions, not our code
- Can be safely ignored as they don't affect our application
- To minimize: disable trading-related browser extensions during development

### 3. Manifest Icon Errors

**Cause**: Missing logo files referenced in manifest.json

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created SVG logo file
- Updated manifest.json to reference existing files only
- Added proper icon fallbacks

### 4. Component Function Errors

**Cause**: Issues with component exports/imports or React.memo usage

**Solutions**:
- Added Error Boundary component to catch React errors gracefully
- Simplified component export patterns
- Removed problematic memoization where unnecessary

## Error Boundary

An error boundary has been added to catch and display React errors gracefully:
- Shows user-friendly error message
- Displays error details in development mode
- Provides options to retry or refresh the page

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Memoization**: Used `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **Context Optimization**: Memoized context values to avoid provider re-renders
3. **Component Splitting**: Separated concerns to isolate potential error sources

## Development Tips

1. Always wrap async operations in try-catch blocks
2. Use Error Boundaries for component-level error handling
3. Memoize expensive computations and callback functions
4. Check for infinite loops in useEffect dependencies
5. Use React DevTools Profiler to identify performance issues

## Browser Extension Conflicts

Some trading-related browser extensions may cause console errors. These can be safely ignored:
- TradingView extensions
- Crypto trading tools
- Stock market extensions

These errors appear as 403 errors in content.js and don't affect application functionality.
